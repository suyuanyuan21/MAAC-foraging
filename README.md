# MAAC-foraging
Code for Multi-Actor-Attention-Critic Reinforcement Learning for Central Place Foraging Swarms

## Requirements
* Python 3.6.1 (Minimum)
* [OpenAI baselines](https://github.com/openai/baselines), commit hash: 98257ef8c9bd23a24a330731ae54ed086d9ce4a7
* It is configured to be run in conjunction with environments from the Multi-Agent Particle Environments (MPE). (https://github.com/openai/multiagent-particle-envs)
  --To install, cd into the root directory and type pip install -e .
* [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/), version: 0.3.0.post4
